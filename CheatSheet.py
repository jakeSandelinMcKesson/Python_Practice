#CheatSheet

#Dictionary (also know as a hashmap):
    #Creation: 
        CharMaps = {}
        #Can use 
        charMaps = defaultdict(list) 
        #to make it so the dictionary automatically creates a key value pair with an empty list (or w/e I choose)
    #Insert:
        CharMaps["thing"] = "this"
    #Appending to a list
        my_dict['key1'].append('value1')
    #Checking Existence of key:
        if "thing" in CharMaps:
    #Update
        my_dict.update({"b": 2}) # Adds "b" to the dictionary
        #Can be used to create or to update a dictionary
    #Sorting a Dictionary
        sorted(topK.items(), key=lambda item: item[1], reverse=True)
    #Print out the values of a dictionary
        print(dictname.values())
    #Find if a value is in a dictionary
        board[r][c] in cols[c] # Just put what every value followed by the dictionary you want to check.. This may be more of a set function as that is what was used


#List:
    #Creation
        #list can be created with just [0,1]
        myList = []
    #append
        myList.append(k)
    #Quickly Sort a list
        nums.sort()
    #find if something exists in a list
        if num in numbers:
    #find location of something in a list
        nums.index(target)
    #limit the area searched
        nums[5:11] #ignores 0 through 5
    #Enumerate:
        #Use this when you want to iterate over a list and reference the indices
        for j, num in enumerate(nums):


#SET
    #Pros of set:
    #Efficient Membership Checks:

    #O(1) on average due to hash table implementation.
    #Example: board[r][c] in cols[c].
    #Handles Duplicates Automatically:

    #Since set does not allow duplicate values, you donâ€™t need to write additional logic to prevent adding the same number multiple times.
    #Fast Insertions:

    #Adding elements to a set is O(1) on average.

#Heaps
    #We can use heaps to track some things like queues  
    # #and a limited amount of sorted numbers easily
    #Creation
        heapq.heapify(minHeap) #Created with a list of ints (minHeap)
    #REmove smallest
        heapq.heappop(minHeap)
    #Add value to heap
        heapq.heappush(minHeap,val)
    #Get lowest value item in heap
        minHeap[0]


#Useful Python Functions:
    #Sorted: takes any iterable (e.g., a string, list, tuple, etc.) and returns a new sorted list of its elements.
        result = sorted("hello")
        print(result) # Output: ['e', 'h', 'l', 'l', 'o']
    #Cool Use to sort dictionaries
        sorted(topK.items(), key=lambda item: item[1], reverse=True)
    #join: 
        #method takes a list (or any iterable) of strings and combines them into a single string. 
        "".join(['a', 'e', 't']) # Output: "aet"
    #Remove all alphanumeric characters

#strings
    s.lower()
    s.isalnum()  #confirm is a letter/string is alphanumeric
    t = (char for char in s if char.isalnum()) # removes all alphanumeric characters

#Linked List
#Reference the classes given you to find the child node. It's easy to go back and forth setting child and parent to other nodes.
